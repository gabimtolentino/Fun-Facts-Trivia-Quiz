# Fun-Facts-Trivia-Quiz
Multiple choice quiz 
This project puts to use my practice of Web APIs.
Some of these practices include DOM traverse, attributes, creating appends, time intervals, and local storage objects.
In this challenge, I had to create a multiple choice quiz.
I decided to make my quiz about random fun facts.
I created a working start button that starts the quiz when selected.
Once you answer a question, it automatically gives you another question.
The application tells you whether or not you answer a question correctly.
I applied a timer that counts down to 20 seconds.
Once the timer ends, the quiz is over.
